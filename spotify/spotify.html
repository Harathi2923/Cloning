            You’ll continue to get access to Premium Student, for up to 12 months from the date you subscribed or last re-verified, while it’s available. If you’re no longer a student at the end of that period, you’ll no longer be eligible for Premium Student. Your subscription will then automatically switch to a Premium Individual plan at ₹119.00/month.
